# SAKOD (Computer data processing structures and algorithms)

I am a student and this repository of lab work I have been doing. I haven't changed anything in the code so that I can track my progress in learning the сomputer data processing structures and algorithms.  In the README file, you can find a list of tasks to easily navigate through the files.

### NOTE
Some code is not quite optimized and optimal, but it works).
There are comments in Russian in the code. 

## Representation of basic C++ data types at the physical level
Labs 1:

Tasks:

First file :
It is required to investigate the binary representation (type unsigned short), (type long double) and (Array: double a[3]) ; 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## Integer arithmetic
Labs 2: 

Tasks:

First file : 
Make a program to convert a natural number from a numbering system with base m to a numbering system with base n, using the decimal numbering system;

Second file :
Find all natural numbers that do not exceed a given m, the decimal notation of which is a strictly decreasing sequence of digits;

Third file :
Write a program to translate a number written in the Roman number system into the Arabic decimal number system.

Fourth file :
For the natural numbers A and B(1 <= A <= 9, 1 <= B <= 104) you need to calculate the value of A^B.

## Estimating the time complexity of algorithms
Labs 3:

Tasks:

First file :
The algorithm for calculating the value of a polynomial using the Gorner scheme.
It is required to analyze and evaluate the time complexity of the given algorithm. As an additional task, it is recommended to implement the given algorithm programmatically and conduct a study of the running time depending on the size of the input data;

 ## Software implementation and comparison of sorting algorithms
Labs 4:

Tasks:  

When performing experiments, you should calculate the number of comparison operations and the number of assignment operations of array elements needed to perform sorting. It is recommended to conduct research on arrays containing 10, 20, 50 and 100 elements each:
from elements selected at random - the average case;
from elements ordered in ascending order - the best case;
from elements ordered in descending order (ordered in reverse order) - worst case.

First file : Even/Odd sorting;

Second file : Shell sorting with step selection in the form of Fibonacci numbers;

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## Solving problems using sorting algorithms
Labs 5:

Tasks: 

First file : 
1.Shell sorting with Knuth step selection;
2.Binary search;
3.Find two elements whose sum is equal to a given number.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## Dynamic data structures
Labs 6:

Tasks:

First file :  Implement a template class of dynamic structure with all its inherent methods (adding new nodes, removing nodes, searching);
A single link linear list;
		   
Second file : Implement a template class of dynamic structure with all its inherent methods (adding new nodes, removing nodes, searching);
Red-black search tree;

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## Backtracking
Labs 7:

Tasks:

First file : 
A chessboard of size N*N is given. Find the number of ways to arrange N queens on it, so that they don't hit each other;

Second file :
Given a number N, you need to find a number and output all ways to represent it as the sum of other M given positive numbers or indicate that there is no such way (each number can be used no more than once);

Third file :
There are n points in the plane. Connect them with a closed broken line of minimal length. The program receives as input the number n≤10. Then comes n pairs of real numbers: coordinates of points.
Output one real number: the minimal length of the closed polyline passing through all these points;
